            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This Play having been entertained with a general Approbation, not only formerly when it's <hi>Compilers</hi> were alive and able to ſupport it both by their <hi>Character</hi> and <hi>Intereſt;</hi> but even now, in this our more <hi>Polite</hi> and <hi>Critical</hi> Age, being lately revived juſt in its own Native and Original <hi>Simplicity,</hi> without being <hi>diſmembred, curtail'd,</hi> or paſſing the <hi>Index Expurgatorius</hi> of any of our Modern <hi>Refiners,</hi> meeting with a kind Reception ſutable to its Merit; ſome <hi>Puny Poetaſter,</hi> diſguiſed under the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verture of a <hi>Petticoat,</hi> hath preſumed to graft his wild degenerate Crab, on this Noble <hi>Stock;</hi> but what delicious Fruit it has produced, I leave to the diſtinguiſhing Taſte of the diſcerning and generous Encouragers of the Stage.</p>
            <p>This ſpurious Brat being now handing into the World by the Midwifry of the Preſs, diſmally Lame, Diſtorted, and Imperfect; and the Town having been ſo penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and judicious, as well as kind and tender, that
<pb facs="tcp:199146:2"/> when this legitimate Off-ſpring of our <hi>Beaumont</hi> and <hi>Fletcher,</hi> appeared on the Stage the very ſame Day as the <hi>By-Blow</hi> did; it ſhewed a true Guſt of Standard-Wit, and quitted the Impoſtor to embrace the Legitimate.</p>
            <p>And indeed our <hi>Loyal Subject</hi> is ſo intirely compleat in all his <hi>Parts,</hi> and ſo well ſtudied and conſidered in all the <hi>Incidents,</hi> that it's Improvement or Correction would be a <hi>Work</hi> for the moſt accurate and ſublime Pen.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it might juſtly be accounted both Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Injuſtice, not to undeceive the World by publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him intire, from the Original, that thoſe who were ſo well pleaſed with him on the Stage, may, when they pleaſe, be entertained by him in their Hands, and the Compoſers Memory and Reputation vindicated from the Imputation of ſuch groſs Abſurdities and ſelf-inconſiſtent Incongrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which often occur in the new modelled ones.</p>

                     <l>I'le tell thee, then; and then thou wilt find the reaſon:</l>
                     <l>The laſt great Muſter, 'twas before ye ſerv'd here,</l>
                     <l>Before the laſt Duke's Death, whoſe honour'd Bones</l>
                     <l>Now reſt in Peace, this young Prince had the ordering,</l>
                     <l>(To Crown his Father's hopes) of all the Army:</l>
                     <l>Who, to be ſhort, put all his Power to Practiſe:</l>
                     <l>Faſhion'd, and drew 'em up; but, alaſs, ſo poorly,</l>
                     <l>So raggedly and looſly, ſo unſoldier'd,</l>
                     <l>The good Duke bluſh'd and call'd unto my Father,</l>
                     <l>Who then was General: Go <hi>Archas</hi> ſpeedily,</l>
                     <l>And chide the Boy, before the Soldier find him,</l>
                     <l>Stand thou between his Ignorance and them,</l>
                     <l>Faſhion their Bodies new to thy Direction;</l>
                     <l>Then draw thou up, and ſhew the Prince his Errors.</l>
                     <l>My Sire obey'd, and did ſo; with all Duty</l>
                     <l>Inform'd the Prince, and read him all Directions:</l>
                     <l>This bred diſtaſte, diſtaſte grew up to anger,</l>
                     <l>And anger into wild Words broke out thus:</l>
                     <l>Well, <hi>Archas,</hi> if I live but to Command here,</l>
                     <l>To be but Duke once, I ſhall then remember,</l>
                     <l>I ſhall remember truly, truſt me, I ſhall,</l>
                     <l>And by my Father's Hand; the reſt his Eyes ſpoke.</l>
                     <l>To which my Father anſwer'd, ſomewhat mov'd too,</l>
                     <l>And with a Vow he ſeal'd it; Royal Sir,</l>

                     <l>Since for my Faith and Fights, your ſcorn and anger</l>
                     <l>Only purſue me; if I live to that day,</l>
                     <l>That day ſo long expected to reward me,</l>
                     <l>By his ſo ever noble Hand you Swore by,</l>
                     <l>And by the Hand of Juſtice, never Arms more</l>
                     <l>Shall rib this Body in, nor Sword hang here, Sir:</l>
                     <l>The Conflicts I will do you Service then in,</l>
